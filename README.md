# containers.jl
Containers as Categories

Hoping to get around to implement https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.01187v1.pdf in Julia with Catlab. Hopefully learning both on the way...
Get in touch (issues !) if you want to join me on this journey...

Status:
 Currently just a dump of old code where I attempted to implement containers in python.
 Python turned out to be poorly suited to this (or I was holding it the wrong way...)
